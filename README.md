# Weather Time

Weather Time is a simple single-page (mixed with some client-side routing) application that will allow you to keep track of cities' current forecast

# Installation 

You'll want to fork and clone this repo; then install any dependencies by running

```bash
npm install
```

# Usage

You can simply type in the search bar below the weather card and hit enter to view the current weather of whatever location you would like!
The Navigation bar in the top left will take you to either a current radar map or a page introducing myself a little bit!

# Issues

Issues are absolutely welcome! Please just make sure to open an issue so we can discuss it.# weather-app
